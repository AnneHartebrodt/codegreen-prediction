# Codegreen-prediction-tool
Python project to deploy renewable energy prediction models 


# Installation 

- **Clone the repository** : `git clone https://github.com/shubhvjain/codegreen-prediction-tool.git`
- **Generate the config file** : 
  - Create a new file named  `.config`  in the root of the project repository
  - Initialize the file will the following :
  ```
  ENTSOE_TOKEN=token
  PREDICTIONS_REDIS_HOST="localhost"
  PREDICTIONS_REDIS_PORT=6379
  PREDICTIONS_REDIS_DB=0
  PREDICTIONS_CRON_JOB_FREQ_HOUR=6
  PREDICTIONS_DOCKER_VOLUME_PATH="/full/local/path"
  ```
- **Initial setup** :  Run `./bin/initial-setup.sh`. 
  - **Note** : This command must be run again if config files are changed
  - **Test run the program** : Before setting up the cron job, to ensure everything is configured correctly, run `./bin/run.sh`
- **Setting up the cron job** : Run `./bin/schedule.sh`. (Note: this script will read the configs from the `.config` file we created in the previous step )


# Setup (incomplete)
- Explanation for the variables : 
  - The ouputs produced after running the models are stored in Redis cache to be further used by the core web service. We need to specify the URL to connect to the Redis server
  - The ouputs generated by the models are also stored in log files for further analysis in the future. We need a path to store the log files
